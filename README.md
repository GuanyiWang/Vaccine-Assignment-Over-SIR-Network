Network_Generation: Generate the random network
- Random_Graph_Generation: We totally generate nine random networks. We choose three number of nodes: N = 200, 500, 800 and three number of edges for each number of node: edges = 7N, 10N, Full.
- Small_Network_Generation: We totally generate nine random networks. We choose three number of nodes: N = 25, 30, 35 and three number of edges for each number of node: edges = 7N, 10N, Full.
- Multiple_Graph_Generation: For each pair number of nodes and number of edges, we generate 20 different random networks. There are totally 9 pairs of number of nodes and number of edges in large network setting. 
- Multiple_small_generation: For each pair number of nodes and number of edges, we generate 20 different random networks. There are totally 9 pairs of number of nodes and number of edges in small network setting.
